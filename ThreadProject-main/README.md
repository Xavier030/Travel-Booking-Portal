Phase 1 work distribution

Sarah
1.	A Main page that will welcome the customer to the site and provide links and menus to the other pages.
2.	A “Contact Us” page that has information about how to phone, email, or go to the agency.
   
Sherry

3.	A “Vacation Package” page listing all vacation packages available.  This will be a static page at this time, but will be enhanced later to be dynamically generated from a database. This could be located on the Main page if your team decides that it would be a better design.

4.	A “Customer Registration” page that will allow a customer to set up an account with Travel Experts by entering their name, address (including city, province, country, and postal code), email address, home phone number, business phone number, user ID, and password, which will be used, after verification, to establish an account for future orders.  The data will be submitted to a test page (use bouncer.php) at this point, but this page will be enhanced later to become an order page with server-side scripting and database access.
